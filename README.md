# Grab Interview Test App - News

An app built as a part of Grab's Software Engineer Interview process.
To build the app from source and use it, get an API key from [News API](https://newsapi.org/register), then put it in the project's **local.properties** file in the format 

```api.key={ADD_API_KEY_HERE}```

replacing *ADD_API_KEY_HERE* with your API key.
